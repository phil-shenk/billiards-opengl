# billiards-opengl
opengl demonstration involving rolling billiard balls, simple lighting, and fake shadows

- ***+ and -*** zoom in and out
- ***i,j,k,l*** moves the light along the plane of the floor & u,o moves it up and down
- ***n*** progresses to the next phase of the animation (it's good to wait until the previous phase has ended)

- ***space*** will move the camera back to the default location
