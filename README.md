# billiards-opengl
opengl demonstration involving rolling billiard balls, simple lighting, and fake shadows

- ***arrow keys*** rotate the camera
- ***+ and -*** zoom in and out
- ***i,j,k,l*** moves the light along the plane of the floor & u,o moves it up and down
- ***n*** progresses to the next phase of the animation (it's good to wait until the previous phase has ended)
- when the balls are moving, ***keys 1,2,3,...,9,0 and a-e*** follow the numbered billiard balls, and ***key f*** follows the cue ball
- ***space*** will move the camera back to the default location

### Instructions
run 'make billiards'
  requires gcc, make, and GLEW, GLUT, opengl, libxmu, libxi
